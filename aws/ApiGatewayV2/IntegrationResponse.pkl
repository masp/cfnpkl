Properties: Props?
class Props {
    IntegrationResponseId: String?
    /// The collection of response templates for the integration response as a
    /// string-to-string map of key-value pairs. Response templates are
    /// represented as a key/value map, with a content-type as the key and a
    /// template as the value.
    ResponseTemplates: Mapping?
    /// The template selection expression for the integration response.
    /// Supported only for WebSocket APIs.
    TemplateSelectionExpression: String?
    /// A key-value map specifying response parameters that are passed to the
    /// method response from the backend. The key is a method response header
    /// parameter name and the mapped value is an integration response header
    /// value, a static value enclosed within a pair of single quotes, or a
    /// JSON expression from the integration response body. The mapping key
    /// must match the pattern of ``method.response.header.{name}``, where
    /// name is a valid and unique header name. The mapped non-static value
    /// must match the pattern of ``integration.response.header.{name}`` or
    /// ``integration.response.body.{JSON-expression}``, where ``{name}`` is a
    /// valid and unique response header name and ``{JSON-expression}`` is a
    /// valid JSON expression without the ``$`` prefix.
    ResponseParameters: Mapping?
    /// Supported only for WebSocket APIs. Specifies how to handle response
    /// payload content type conversions. Supported values are
    /// ``CONVERT_TO_BINARY`` and ``CONVERT_TO_TEXT``, with the following
    /// behaviors:   ``CONVERT_TO_BINARY``: Converts a response payload from a
    /// Base64-encoded string to the corresponding binary blob.
    /// ``CONVERT_TO_TEXT``: Converts a response payload from a binary blob to
    /// a Base64-encoded string.  If this property is not defined, the
    /// response payload will be passed through from the integration response
    /// to the route response or method response without modification.
    ContentHandlingStrategy: String?
    /// The integration ID.
    IntegrationId: String?
    /// The integration response key.
    IntegrationResponseKey: String?
    /// The API identifier.
